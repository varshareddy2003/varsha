Requirement Analysis and Planning.
1.	Gather detailed requirements: This involves collecting and documenting all the necessary information about the project, including the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, users, and the business.
2.	Define user stories and use cases: User stories are brief descriptions of the project's functionality from the user's perspective, while use cases describe the interactions between the user and the system. This task helps to identify the functional requirements of the project.
3.	Identify functional and non-functional requirements: Functional requirements describe what the system must do, while non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform. This task involves identifying and documenting both types of requirements.
4.	Document edge cases and error handling scenarios: Edge cases refer to unusual or extreme scenarios that the system may encounter, while error handling scenarios describe how the system should respond to errors or exceptions. This task involves documenting these scenarios to ensure the system is robust and can handle unexpected situations
Based on the Requirement Analysis and Planning phase of the VisionMate project, the required data can be categorized into the following:
Functional Requirements:
1.	User Stories:
•	As a visually impaired user, I want to receive real-time GPS-based navigation with audio cues for directions so that I can navigate unfamiliar environments safely.
•	As a visually impaired user, I want to receive voice prompts for nearby points of interest, intersections, and obstacles so that I can avoid hazards.
•	As a visually impaired user, I want to be able to request assistance from a remote assistant in case of an emergency so that I can get help when needed.
2.	Use Cases:
•	User requests navigation to a specific location
•	User receives real-time navigation instructions
•	User encounters an obstacle or hazard
•	User requests assistance from a remote assistant
3.	Functional Requirements:
•	Real-time GPS-based navigation with audio cues for directions
•	Voice prompts for nearby points of interest, intersections, and obstacles
•	Integration with map services (e.g., Google Maps) for accurate location tracking
•	Remote assistance feature for emergency situations
Non-Functional Requirements:
1.	Performance Requirements:
•	Response time for navigation instructions: < 2 seconds
•	Accuracy of location tracking: < 10 meters
2.	Security Requirements:
•	Data encryption for user location and navigation data
•	Secure authentication and authorization for remote assistance feature
3.	Usability Requirements:
•	Intuitive user interface for visually impaired users
•	Clear and concise audio cues and voice prompts
•	Simple and easy-to-use remote assistance feature
Edge Cases and Error Handling Scenarios:
1.	Edge Cases:
•	User is in a location with poor GPS signal strength
•	User is in a location with no internet connectivity
•	User encounters an unexpected obstacle or hazard
2.	Error Handling Scenarios:
•	Navigation instructions are not received within the expected timeframe
•	Voice prompts are not clear or are interrupted
•	Remote assistance feature is unavailable or unresponsive
